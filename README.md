All of my Quantum Circuits


Quantum Computing is becoming a reality, as IBM has released its quantum computers to the world. There is quite a lot of support for running programs on quantum computers, and this is what this repository explores.

Quantum Programs are run using Quantum Circuits, and this repository contains all of my quantum circuits. Most of them are general algorithms, but some of them are ones I thought on my own!
